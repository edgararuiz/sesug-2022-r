  - `read_xpt()` reads SAS transport files, versions 5 & 8
  
- **SPSS**

- **Stata**

## Output

* Are [tibbles](https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble), which have a better print
  method for very long and very wide files.
  
* Translate value labels into a new `labelled()` class, which preserves the
  original semantics, and can easily be coerced to factors with `as_factor()`.
  
* Special missing values are preserved. See the [Conversion semantics](https://haven.tidyverse.org/articles/semantics.html) on the `haven`'s
  package official site.

* Dates and times are converted to R date/time classes. Character vectors are
  not converted to factors.

## Other packages

* [foreign](https://cran.r-project.org/package=foreign) reads from 
  SAS XPORT, SPSS, and Stata (up to version 12) files.

* [readstat13](https://cran.r-project.org/package=readstata13) reads from 
  and writes to all Stata file format versions.

* [sas7bdat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sas7bdat) reads from
  SAS7BDAT files.
